                                        *According to Wikipedia: Minotaur is a mythical creature portrayed in Classical
                                        times
                                        with the head and tail of a bull and the body of a man or, as described by Roman
                                        poet
                                        Ovid, a being "part man and part bull". He dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth,
                                        which
                                        was an elaborate maze-like construction designed by the architect Daedalus and
                                        his son
                                        Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete. The Minotaur was eventually
                                        killed by the
                                        Athenian hero Theseus.</p>
